    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
        <li>
            Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in Dutch oven over medium heat 
            until well browned.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water.
            Season with sugar, 2 tbsp parsley, basil, 1 tsp salt, Italian seasoning, fennel 
            seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered for about 1.5 hours, stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling 
            water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tbsps parsley,
            and 1/2 tsp salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch
            baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly.
            Spread with 1/2 of ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese
            slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup
            Parmesan cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with
            foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the
            foil does not touch the cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an
            additional 25 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.
